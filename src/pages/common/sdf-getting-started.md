## Getting Started

We assume you already have a Registration for which [SDF is applicable](#prerequisites).

## Prerequisites

- An active Adobe I/O Events registration which is compatible with SDF:
    - Only includes [CloudEvents](https://cloudevents.io) deliveries.
    - [AWS EventBridge](/guides/amazon-eventbridge/index.md) is not configured among the delivery methods.
- Access to the Adobe I/O Events API with proper authentication
    - You can either use the Developer Console or add your filters through the [Registration APIs](/guides/api/registration-api.md)
- Understanding of JSON syntax and your event payload structure
    - Check the [filtering language details](/guides/subscriber_defined_filtering/dsl.md)
